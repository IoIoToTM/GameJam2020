Game created for the 2020 stay at home game jam I participated in. This is the code as is, haven't touched it since the jam. Fell free to use it as you see fit, learn from it, or whatever you want.

This is a short game that uses a few different mechanics, inspired by BLAWK (https://im-a-good-boye.itch.io/blawk) and WindowFrame (https://managore.itch.io/windowframe)

Strange things start happening with the world and the game, and you have to explore together with your character and get to the end of this mystery.


This is my first game that I have done everything alone (art, music (it might be a bit repetitive but I didn't have time), and almost all code (of course, stackoverflow was heavily used)). It's also my first time using Godot instead of Unity, so I hope I've done a good job and you enjoy it.

IMPORTANT : If you have scaling set to something different than 100%, for the game to work properly you need to right click on the executable, go to Properties->Compatiiblity->Change high DPI settings - check High DPI scaling override and select Application, and Apply that. The game was only tested on a 1920x1080 screen, so I can't say how the game would behave in other higher or lower resolutions.
